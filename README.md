# LIVM
LaIn (LIne)  Virtual Machine

Why LIVM was created: LIVM was created to convert code between different programming languages
How LIVM helps to convert it: LIVM as abstraction is a set of instructions, that can be commonly used in programming languages
LIVM uses FaXm to compile it's assembler to bytecode, but convertion must be done before FaXm code compiles to bytecode like in diagram:
